✋ Never store on bare floor

**Tips for Year-Round Storage:**
• Use silica gel packets for extra moisture control
• Label with storage date
• Store in shade, rotate stock
• Keep old rice separate from new
• Check temperature monthly

**When to Throw Away:**
🗑️ After 12 months (quality decreases)
🗑️ If moldy smell appears
🗑️ If insects are widespread
🗑️ If grain gets wet
🗑️ If severe discoloration occurs

**Pro Farmer Tips:**
💡 Store during dry season (Nov-Dec best)
💡 Never store wet rice
💡 Keep rice separate from dal/pulses
💡 Use thick plastic bags for extra protection
